# Word Count Tracking

Target: **<= 1000 words** (excluding cover sheet, references, appendices — follow module guidance).

## Drafts
- v1: 1227 words (pre-edit main body count measured from report text extraction before revision)
- v2: 784 words (post-edit main body count)
- final: 784 words (current submission version)

## Notes
- Counting method used: `textutil` extraction + `awk` count up to (excluding) the `References` heading.
- This count is an automated check; final institutional count should be confirmed in Microsoft Word if required.
